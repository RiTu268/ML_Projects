## 1. Website_Phishing: 
<p>Phishing attack is used to steal confidential information of a user. Fraud 
websites appears like genuine websites with the logo and graphics of genuine 
website. This project aims to detect fraud or phishing website using data mining 
techniques. W3C standard defines characteristics which can be used to 
distinguish a legal and fraud website. These characteristics can be used for 
classification. Phishing website dataset is taken from UCI machine learning 
repository. The dataset was collected by analysing a collection of 2456 websites 
among which some were used for phishing and others not. By using data mining 
techniques, we will generate a classification model which is used to manage and 
model data. This helps to make a prediction whether the website is legal or 
fraud.</p>

### <p>Intermediate steps of project:</p>
<p>1) Collect dataset containing malicious and legitimate websites.</p>
<p>2) Writing code to divide the dataset into training and testing sets and 
code for displaying the evaluation results.</p>
<p>3) Run the classification algorithm on the dataset.</p>
<p>4) Observe the results for the model generated and specify the outcomes</p>

### <p> Conclusion: </p>
<p>1) The output we achieved is increase accuracy, increase recall and decrease 
false positive rate so that most of the points are classified correctly and 
the number of phishing websites labelled as legitimate is reduced.</p>
<p>2) By using data mining 
techniques, we have generated a classification model which is used to 
manage and model data. This helps to make a prediction whether the 
website is legal or fraud.</p>
